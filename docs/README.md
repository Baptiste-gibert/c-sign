## About

c-sign is a web application built for the Transparency & Market Intelligence department at Ceva Sante Animale. It digitizes attendance sheets for corporate events such as meetings, training sessions, and meals with veterinary professionals. Organizers create events and share QR codes; participants scan and sign directly on their phones -- no app install, no account required.
