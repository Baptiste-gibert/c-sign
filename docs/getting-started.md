## Step 4: Create your first event

1. Click the **Creer un evenement** button on the dashboard.
2. Fill in the event details: name, date, location, and type of event.
3. Save the event.

Your new event now appears on your dashboard, ready to use.

> **Tip:** You can create events ahead of time and open them for signatures only when the event starts.

## Step 5: Open the event and collect signatures

1. Open the event from your dashboard.
2. Share the QR code displayed on screen with your participants.
3. Participants scan the QR code on their phones and sign directly from their browser.

No app installation is required for participants. They simply scan, fill in their details, and sign.

## You are all set

You are now ready to run paperless attendance sheets at your events. Here is a quick recap of the workflow:

1. **Log in** to c-sign before your event.
2. **Create an event** with the relevant details.
3. **Display the QR code** at your event for participants to scan.
4. **Collect signatures** in real time on participant phones.
5. **Review attendance** from your dashboard after the event.
