# FAQ / Common Issues

Answers to frequently asked questions about c-sign, organized by category.

## Login and Account

### I cannot log in. What should I check?

Verify that you are using the correct email address and password. Passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure Caps Lock is off. If you recently changed your password, use the new one.

### My account is locked after several failed attempts.

Your account is automatically locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts. Wait a few minutes and try again, or contact your administrator to unlock it manually.

### I forgot my password.

Contact your administrator. They can reset your password from the admin panel. There is no self-service password reset at this time.

### I never received my login credentials.

Only administrators can create organizer accounts. Contact the person who manages c-sign at your organization and ask them to create an account for you.

## Events

### I cannot see my event on the dashboard.

Check the status filter at the top of the dashboard. By default, the list may be filtered to show only active events. Switch to **All** or the relevant status to find your event.

If another organizer created the event, you may not have access to it. Each organizer sees only the events they created.

### How do I reopen an event that has been finalized?

Open the event management page and look for the option to change the event status back to **open**. Reopening an event allows participants to sign again and lets you make further edits.

> **Warning:** Reopening a finalized event should be done with caution. Any new signatures added after reopening will appear alongside the original ones.

### How do I add a walk-in participant?

Walk-in participants sign the same way as anyone else. Display the QR code or share the signing link with them. They scan, fill in their information, and submit their signature directly from their phone.

There is no need to pre-register participants. The signing form is open to anyone with the link while the event is active.

### Can I edit an event after creating it?

Yes. Open the event from your dashboard and modify its details (name, dates, location, sessions) as needed. Changes take effect immediately.

## Signing and QR Codes

### The QR code is not working for participants.

Check the following:

- **Event status:** The event must be in an active/open state. If it has been finalized or is still in draft, the QR code will not lead to a working signing page.
- **Expired or regenerated token:** If you regenerated the QR code or sharing token, any previously shared links will stop working. Share the new QR code with participants.
- **Network issues:** Participants need an internet connection on their phone. Ask them to check their mobile data or Wi-Fi.

### The signing page shows an error message.

This usually means one of the following:

- The event has been finalized and is no longer accepting signatures.
- The sharing token in the link is invalid because it was regenerated.
- The URL was copied incorrectly and is incomplete.

Ask the organizer to confirm the event is open and to provide a fresh QR code or link.

### Can participants sign on a tablet or computer?

Yes. The signing page works on any device with a modern web browser. However, it is optimized for phone screens since most participants sign on their phones at events.

### A participant wants to sign again or correct their signature.

Each form submission creates a separate attendance record. If a participant needs to re-sign, they can scan the QR code again and submit a new entry. The organizer can remove duplicate entries from the event management page.

### What happens to signatures after they are submitted?

Signatures are uploaded to the server immediately upon submission. Nothing is saved on the participant's phone. The organizer can view and export all collected signatures from the event management page.

## Language

### How do I switch between French and English?

Tap or click the language toggle in the top-right corner of any page. The interface switches immediately. This works on both the organizer dashboard and the participant signing page.

> **Tip:** The language preference does not persist between sessions. You may need to toggle it again on your next visit.

### Is the signing page available in languages other than French and English?

No. c-sign currently supports French and English only. French is the default language.

## Export

### I clicked export but did not receive the file.

Check your browser's downloads folder. The export file is generated as an XLSX spreadsheet and should download directly.

If the download did not start, try again. Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-ups or downloads from the c-sign URL.

### The export file does not include all participants.

Verify that all expected participants have actually submitted their signatures. The export contains only the entries recorded at the time of export. If participants signed after you generated the file, export again to get the updated list.

### What format is the export?

Attendance sheets are exported as XLSX (Excel) files. Each row represents one participant, and signature images are embedded in the spreadsheet.

## Mobile Signing Tips

### The signature canvas is too small.

Turn your phone to landscape orientation. The canvas expands to use the wider screen, giving you more room to draw.

### My signature looks shaky or messy.

Rest your hand on a stable surface while signing. Use the pad of your finger rather than the tip. If you are unsatisfied with the result, tap the clear button and try again before submitting.

### The page scrolls when I try to sign.

The signature canvas captures touch input and should prevent the page from scrolling while you are drawing. If the page still scrolls, make sure you are touching inside the canvas area and not on the surrounding form.
