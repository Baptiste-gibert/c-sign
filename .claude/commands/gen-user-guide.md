description: Generate complete user documentation with automated screenshots
---

Use the user-guide skill to generate end-user documentation for this project.

**Before starting:**

1. Verify docker-compose is running (app on localhost:3000 + playwright MCP)
2. Ask me for test login credentials
3. Show me the discovered sitemap for approval before capturing screenshots

**App URL:** http://localhost:3000
**Playwright MCP:** Configured in .mcp.json (http://playwright:8931/mcp)
**Output:** GitHub-native markdown in docs/ (no static site generator)

Generate the full user guide following the skill workflow.
After completion, show me a summary of pages documented, screenshots captured, and any issues.
