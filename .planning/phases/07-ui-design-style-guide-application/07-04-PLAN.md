<objective>
End-to-end human verification of the complete theme system: organizer theme selection, public page rendering with each theme, typography, microinteractions, and responsive layout.

Purpose: Confirm the visual design matches the C-SIGN Design System v2.0 specification and the full flow works from organizer configuration to public page display.
Output: Verified phase completion.

  <name>Task 2: Human verification of complete theme system</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Present the following verification checklist to the user. This task verifies the complete C-SIGN Design System v2.0 implementation:

What was built:
- Dark-mode themed public signing page with generative gradient header
- 4 built-in color palettes (Tech Modern, Vibrant Purple, Nature Teal, Energy Orange)
- Custom accent color support with WCAG contrast validation
- Per-event theme selection on organizer dashboard
- Inter font typography with design system scale
- Microinteractions (focus ring, submit loading, success animation)
- Responsive 2-col/1-col grid layout

Verification steps for the user:

1. Organizer theme selection (http://localhost:5173/login)
   - Log in as organizer
   - Create a new event OR edit an existing event
   - Verify the ThemeSelector shows 4 palette cards with color swatches
   - Select "Vibrant Purple" theme
   - Verify the selection is saved (page should not revert on reload)

2. Public signing page with theme (http://localhost:5173/sign/{dayId})
   - Open the signing page for the event with Vibrant Purple theme
   - Verify: dark purple background, purple accent on inputs/buttons, generative gradient header
   - Verify: "C-SIGN" branding in header with accent color
   - Verify: Event title and date displayed in header
   - Verify: Accent line below header
   - Verify: Form card with slightly lighter surface background
   - Verify: Inter font is used (check in browser DevTools, Computed, font-family)
   - Verify: 2-column grid on desktop for Nom/Prenom and Ville/N-pro
   - Resize to mobile width: verify 1-column stacking

3. Signature canvas
   - Verify: White background canvas with colored accent border
   - Verify: Crosshair cursor when hovering over canvas
   - Draw a signature: verify dark stroke (#1a1a2e)

4. Submit and success page
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Verify: Submit button uses accent color, shows loading state (opacity reduction)
   - Verify: Success page shows animated checkmark (scale + opacity animation)
   - Verify: "Merci !" text with themed styling

5. Theme switching (change to different themes)
   - Go back to organizer dashboard, change event theme to "Energy Orange"
   - Reload the signing page: verify warm orange tones
   - Change to "Nature Teal": verify teal-green tones
   - Change to "Tech Modern" (default): verify cyan tones

6. Custom accent color
   - In organizer dashboard, select custom accent
   - Pick a bright pink (#e91e8c) using the color picker
   - Verify the signing page shows pink-toned dark theme
   - Try a very light color (#ffff00): verify contrast warning appears

7. Responsive and accessibility
   - Check that text is readable against dark backgrounds
   - Verify focus states show accent-colored ring on inputs
   - Verify the page is usable on mobile viewport (320px width minimum)

Resume signal: Type "approved" if the design matches expectations, or describe any visual issues to fix.
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms the visual design matches C-SIGN Design System v2.0 specification.</verify>
  <done>All 7 Phase 7 success criteria verified by human inspection: dark-mode design, 4 palettes, per-event theme selection, theme rendering on public page, theme generation algorithm, Inter typography scale, WCAG AA contrast.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All 7 success criteria from ROADMAP.md Phase 7 are verified:
1. Public signing page uses dark-mode themed design with CSS custom properties
2. 4 built-in color palettes available
3. Organizer can select a theme or custom accent color per event
4. Public signing page renders using the event's chosen theme
5. Theme generation algorithm derives full palette from a single accent color
6. Typography follows Inter font stack with defined scale
7. WCAG AA contrast ratios maintained across all generated themes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 4 built-in themes render correctly on the public signing page
- Custom accent colors generate valid dark themes
- Theme persists per event (reload does not lose selection)
- Inter font and typography scale match the design system
- Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop
- Success page animation plays smoothly
</success_criteria>
